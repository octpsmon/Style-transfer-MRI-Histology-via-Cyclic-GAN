Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is an extremely sensitive probe of tissue microstructure and the only non-invasive measure of the brain's fiber architecture at the moment. As this technique gets more sophisticated, comparing MRI with microscopic imaging in the same tissue samples becomes more valuable and can be beneficial for the patient not required to have undergo the invasive biopsy procedure. 
This study demonstrates a method for generating microscopic images from MRI of the brain using cyclic-GAN architecture. The technique includes training paired image translation models taking sets of images from corpus callosum MRI scans and microscopy.
